    "The importance of data, its accuracy and availability when and where needed, cannot be overestimated when it comes to business prosperity and leadership. For a company operating on a large scale, getting as close to data as possible becomes even more critical. That’s what our client came to us for. With a huge number of internal users, disparate systems and isolated islands of data began to take a toll on the entire data analysis process resulting in inaccurate insights, poor business decisions and missed market opportunities. Our team was entrusted with the task of creating an AI-driven big data and self-service business intelligence platform to provide the client’s almost 3 million internal users with hassle-free on-demand data access.",
